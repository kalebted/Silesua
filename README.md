# Silesua

Silesua is a versatile Android based mini-social media application built by Flutter technology by Yanosats team of developers.

Features:

The application targets women who could be abuse victims and need a place to feel at home, like they belong.
Silesua provides a judgment free community where these women can feel safe and share their problems and worry to address their mental health help needs.
The application has stories, blogs, events and biographies feed relaying uplifting and motivating messages for its viewers.
Users also have the access to contact Psychological and legal consultants where they can get quick and direct access to the help they need.
The application allows for users to setup and contact meetings with these consultants for free.
We also provided an anonymous chat feature where these women can intercact with the application community with out having to disclose their identity until they feel like doing so.

We have implemented a venting section where our users can speak what's bothering them and post their feelings to the society online.

A woman currently in a dangerous situation can send an SOS alert with her location directly from the app, even in situations she could't call the authorities.
